# Generative AI Platforms: A Practical Exploration

## Introduction

In this practical session, we will delve into the world of generative AI platforms and explore their capabilities in creating engaging content. We will focus on two main tasks: generating an Instagram reel or YouTube short using AI-powered tools, and creating a conversational podcast with various AI-assisted audio generation tools.

## Task 1: Create an Instagram Reel or YouTube Short with AI

### Step 1: Generate Script

Visit [Squibler.io AI Story Generator](https://www.squibler.io/ai-story-generator) and provide a topic such as adventure, mystery, or a specific genre. The AI will generate a short story based on the provided topic. In this example, we will generate a rom-com story.

### Step 2: Generate Video

Visit [Veed.io Text-to-Video AI Tool](https://www.veed.io/tools/ai-video/text-to-video) and provide the short story generated in Step 1. The AI will create a small video based on the story.

## Task 2: Generate Conversational Podcast with AI Tools

### Step 1: Generate Podcast Script

Use an AI language model like Claude AI or ChatGPT to generate a podcast script for a specific topic. For example, you could prompt the AI with: "Create a conversation between three friends. The topic is a mysterious classroom. Provide one sentence for each person as dialogue. Generate the script."

### Step 2: Convert Text to Voice

1. Save the generated script into a text file (e.g., `podcast_script.txt`).
2. Visit [Murf AI](https://www.murf.ai/) and import the text file.
3. Split the dialogues and assign different character voices to each dialogue.
4. Click the "Play" button for each dialogue to generate the audio.
5. Click the "Play" button at the bottom to create a complete audio file.
6. Download the generated audio file.

### Step 3: Publish Podcast

Upload the generated audio file to podcast platforms or video-sharing platforms like YouTube, providing appropriate titles, descriptions, and tags.

In this example, we will create a podcast about the story of Krishna and Ashwatthama.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can explore the capabilities of generative AI platforms in creating engaging content such as Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and conversational podcasts.
